## Notes
* This is a school assignment I implemented. It uses inverse kinematics to determine the position of a characters arms. To do so, it calculates the sudo jacobian matrix for effeciency rather than calculating the inverse kinematic matrix need to determine this positions. The entire project code base is over one GB(due to external libraries for animation). Can provide if needed.
