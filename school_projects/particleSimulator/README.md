## Notes
* This folder contains code for a particle simimulator assignment I implemented. It implements the following integration methods: euler, symplectic_euler, and verlet methods to calculate the position and velocity in the next timestep. It uses penalty methods for ground collision. 
* The entire project code base is over one GB(due to external libraries for animation). Can provide if needed. 

* Link to video: will include link soon
